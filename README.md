# Color-picker-Chrome-Extension
I created a Color Picker Chrome Extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling seamless colour selection on webpages. Leveraging Chrome Extension APIs, it captures colours from elements and presents them in a convenient popup interface. and automatically copy it to the clipboard.
